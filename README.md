# DtuTextRecognition
There are two main feature of this app.
1. Automatic Extractive Text Summarization 
2. Sign Language Recognition 

Automatic Extractive text summarization is the way toward shortening a text document record to make an outline with significant purposes of unique archives. This strategy is demonstrated useful to sum up the news stories and talks notes. 
So, this android application implement summarizer which will generate summary from text by getting text from the frames of camera and display the result on the screen.

There is a lot of communication gap between the deaf peoples and the hearing majority. Innovations in sign language recognition will reduce the communication barrier for these communities. So we considers a recognition system using camera, convolution neural networks (CNNs) and CPU acceleration.
At present stage we are able to predict the Alphabets and working towards Word Recognition.

COMPATIBILITY: This app is compatible with almost every android devices with android version 7 or above.
This app is build with Camera 2 api
